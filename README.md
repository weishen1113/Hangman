## Description

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The purpose of this application is to provide an engaging and educational experience where players can improve their vocabulary, spelling skills, and problem-solving abilities. It is designed to be fun and challenging, suitable for players of all ages.

## Design and Use

We provide users with 4 different game modes:

- **Easy Mode**:

  - Guessing words in this mode is more forgiving, with more attempts allowed.
  - Ideal for beginners or those looking for a relaxed gaming experience.

- **Hard Mode**:

  - This mode is for the more experienced players who seek a challenge.
  - Guessing words correctly in this mode requires precision and strategy.
  - Players have fewer attempts compared to easy mode.

- **Two-Player Mode**:

  - Challenge your friends or family members to a game of Hangman.
  - Send challenges to other players, specifying the word and providing a hint if desired.
  - Once the challenge is accepted, the challenging player competes to guess the word first.
  - Players who receive a challenge will be notified. Once the challenge is completed, the challenging player will also be notified.

- **Competitive Mode**:
  - Players are given random difficult words to guess.
  - Earn points for correctly guessing words and lose points for incorrect guesses.
  - Each player's score is displayed on the leaderboard, showcasing their Hangman skills.
